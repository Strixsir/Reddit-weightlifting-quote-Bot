this is for a Reddit Bot hosted on Repl.it 24/7 free

Normally we would use a VPS or rasberry pie for 24/7 use but repl.it also works

the server will be killed by repl.it in 3 hours their is no visit to that server link so we have to find a way to do that

**the KEEP_ALIVE file, just fork it as it is and dont change it, it's simply an empty server as repl.it does not allow 24/7 stream function for more than 30 mins unless we apply this hack to it and make it a running server  **

Use https://uptimerobot.com/, it's free and link your bot repl.it server to this so that bot does not die, it also mails you if your bot dies/server goes down
